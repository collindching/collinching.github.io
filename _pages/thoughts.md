Lean in when things get difficult. These are the times when you learn the most. 

Rely on yourself to get things done at the end of the day. 

When training, the more iterations you do, the more you improve. Analogously with a project, the more iterations you do, the greater chances of success. Think of each iteration as a small percentage increase in your success probability. 

If you can develop resilience to failure and discouragement, your ability to grow is limitless.

You have only truly failed when you give up trying new ideas. Everything else was a learning opportunity. 

In order to be creative, you need to know your fundamentals extremely well.
