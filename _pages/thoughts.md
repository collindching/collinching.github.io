## Guidelines

- Dream big, and think long-term
- Understand context
- Set specific goals 
- Be tenacious
- Make good plans
- Take nothing personally

## Problem solving strategies

Framework for problem solving -- spend time on each step

1. Describe (understand)
2. Strategize (plan, decompose)
3. Implement (do it)
4. Adjust (review)

Invest time in developing context and understanding details of problem. And don't be discouraged if a solution doesn't work -- this is how you learn

## Perseverance

Iterate as much as possible. The more you iterate, the greater your chances of succes. 

After each iteration, review what went right and what didn't so you can calibrate the next iteration.

If you continue to persevere, you will eventually find the solution.

## Working under pressure

Even though you may be pressed for time, stay calm. Give yourself time to think, strategize, execute, and review. Don't pass of your work without checking it.

Moreover, see pressure as an opportunity to test different strategies. If you lean in when things get difficult, you're turning challenges into useful experience.

## Failure

Never be discouraged. You only stop growing when you get discouraged and give up. 

If you continue to pick yourself up and learn from experiences, you will grow and succeed.
