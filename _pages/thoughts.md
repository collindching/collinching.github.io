## Problem solving strategies

Framework for problem solving -- spend time on each step.

1. Describe (understand)
2. Strategize (plan, decompose)
3. Implement (do it)
4. Adjust (review)

Invest time in developing context and understanding details of problem. Then state your problem and goal verbally and explicitly.

As you develop context, take stock of available information, and work that has already been done.

Limit unnecessary cognitive load by discarding information that's irrelevant to the problem. 

If a problem becomes too large, decompose it into smaller steps. This helps you manage complexity and morale.

If a problem is fairly complex, solve the simplest version of that problem, then iteratively increase in complexity.

If a solution attempt doesn't work. Analyze why it didn't work. How far off was your solution? Will you arrive at the solution with some minor tweaks? Are there are alternative ways to come to the solution?

## Perseverance

Iterate as much as possible. The more you iterate, the greater your chances of succes. 

After each iteration, review what went right and what didn't so you can calibrate the next iteration.

If you continue to persevere, you will eventually find the solution.

## Working under pressure

Even though you may be pressed for time, stay calm. Give yourself time to think, strategize, execute, and review. Don't pass of your work without checking it.

Moreover, see pressure as an opportunity to test different strategies. By leaning in when things get difficult, you take advantage of challenges to test character and strategic thinking.

## Failure

Never be discouraged. You only stop growing when you get discouraged and give up. 

If you continue to pick yourself up and learn from experiences, you will grow and succeed.
