## Principles

- Always do your best
- Don't take things personally

## Perseverance

**Iterations:** Iterate as much as possible. The more you iterate, the greater your chances of succes. 

One caveat: make sure you aren't blindly iterating. You should regularly evaluate all possible options, to ensure you're iterating in the right direction. 

## Working under pressure

**Embracing challenge:** Lean in when things get difficult. Challenges make for the best learning opportunities.

**Be self-reliant:** Rely on yourself to get things done at the end of the day. Leave nothing to chance or wishful thinking.

## Failure

**Resilience:** If you can develop resilience to failure and discouragement, your ability to grow is limitless.

**Fail until success:** You have only failed when you give up. Everything else is a learning experience.

## Creativity

**Creativity 101:** Creativity is a slippery word and I don't like its connotations. But if you are urged to be creative or "think outside the box", you should first know your fundamentals well.
