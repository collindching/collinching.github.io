## Who I am

I'm Collin, a data scientist from the Bay Area. I studied statistics at UCLA and am a Metis graduate. 

Right now, I'm doing data science at Facebook in the marketing domain. I work on quantifying marketing performance through [marketing (or marketing) mix modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_mix_modeling). 

In my spare time, I like to read, play ping pong, and go on walks. 

## Writing

Writing forces me to rigorously assert and defend my thoughts. As I improve my technical skills and gain knowledge knowledge, I plan to write to solidify my understanding, develop opinions, and record ideas.

## Problem solving framework

1. Describe: Invest time in developing context and understanding details of problem. Then state your problem and goal verbally and explicitly.
2. Research: Look for examples where others solved your problem, or a related problem.
3. Strategize: Create a plan of attack for your problem. If a problem becomes too large, decompose it into smaller steps to manage complexity and morale. If a problem is too complex, solve the simplest version of that problem first.
4. Implement: Carry out your plan.
5. Adjust: Analyze why your strategy did or didn't work. Assess the difference between your result and a workable solution. Determine whether to make a minor tweak, or big direction change. Consider alternate ways to arrive at a solution.
