## Who I am

I'm Collin, a data scientist born and raised in the Bay Area. I studied statistics at UCLA and graduated in 2018. 

I'm a contract marketing decision scientist at FANG, where I build marketing mix models. Before this, I studied data science at Metis.

Currently, I'm focused on optimizing my technical skills and career capital. The goal is to leverage these for autonomy and social impact later on.  

Outside of work, I like to cook, watch Netflix, and play table tennis and other sports.

## Motivations for blogging

"Writing is a concentrated form of thinking. I donâ€™t know what I think about certain subjects, even today, until I sit down and try to write about them. Maybe I wanted to find more rigorous ways of thinking." (Don LeLillo)

After stumbling upon the above quote, I knew that I wanted to write more. I started building this blog a day later. 

My plan is to use this website to help me think more deeply about data science, personal philosophy, current events, and, frankly, everything. 

In order of priority, here are my reasons for writing. 

1. Actively process new information 
2. Define personal ideas and opinions 
3. Keep a live record of my knowledge 
4. Practice communication 
5. Have a portfolio
