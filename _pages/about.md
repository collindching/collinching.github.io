## Who I am

I leverage statistics, programming, and my thinking cap to drive business decisions. I'm equally versed in Python and R, and am handy with Excel. 

I received my bachelors in statistics from UCLA and am continuing my education here. 

Currently, I'm a contract marketing decision scientist at a FAANG company in the Bay. 

## Motivations for blogging

"Writing is a concentrated form of thinking. I donâ€™t know what I think about certain subjects, even today, until I sit down and try to write about them. Maybe I wanted to find more rigorous ways of thinking." (Don LeLillo)

After stumbling upon the above quote, I knew that I wanted to write more. I started building this blog a day later. 

I believe writing will help me think more deeply about data science, personal philosophy, current events, and, frankly, everything. 

Here are my personal reasons for writing, in order of priority. 

1. Actively process new information 
2. Define personal ideas and opinions 
3. Keep a live record of my knowledge 
4. Practice communication 
5. Have a portfolio

And my girlfriend.
