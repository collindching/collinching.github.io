## Who I am

I'm Collin, a data scientist from the Bay Area. I studied statistics at UCLA and am a Metis graduate. 

Right now, I build models to gauge marketing performance at Facebook via [marketing mix modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_mix_modeling). In my spare time, I like to read, learn data science, cook, and play ping pong. 

## Reading

For me, fiction and non-fiction are both valuable for different functions.

Fiction for historical/cultural experience, perspective, adventure and non-fiction for practical/worldly knowledge, self-optimization, domain exposure.

In addition to reading, I try to actively synthesize what I read through writing and application. 

## Writing

Writing is an exercise in critically synthesizing knowledge. I think writing can be broken down into three parts: 1) summarizing, 2) drawing connections to your life and other knowledge, and 3) expressing personal opinions.

I believe in writing about what I read, think about, and work on as a healthy habit thinking exercise. 

## Learning by doing

There are many ways to learn -- by studying, teaching, and/or doing. I think learning by doing is the most challenging and efficient way to learn. 

Prioritize learning by doing, pick up necessary theory along the way. You don't need to know everything before you start.

## Problem solving 

1. Describe: Gather problem details, ask critical questions, and define primary goal
2. Research: Look for previous solution help 
3. Strategize: Plan action steps
    - If your problem is overwhelmingly complex, decompose it
    - Consider also solving a simpler version of the problem first
4. Implement
5. Adjust: Evaluate success, analyze outcomes, determine necessary changes

## Learning optimism

Pay attention to how you respond to adversity. What do you tell yourself when you make mistakes? 

Challenge negative things that you tell yourself; embrace mistakes; have a growth mindset.
