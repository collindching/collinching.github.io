## Who I am

I'm Collin, a data scientist from the Bay Area. I studied statistics at UCLA and am a Metis graduate. 

Right now, I build models to gauge marketing performance at Facebook via [marketing mix modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_mix_modeling). In my spare time, I like to read, learn data science, cook, and play ping pong. 

## Reading

For me, fiction and non-fiction are both valuable for different functions.

Fiction for historical/cultural experience, perspective, adventure and non-fiction for practical/worldly knowledge, self-optimization, domain exposure.

In addition to reading, I try to actively synthesize what I read through writing and application. 

## Ask good questions

Given a problem, you might not immediately identify the best solution. But you can quickly pose good questions which, answered thoughtfully, will lead to great solutions.

Before embarking on any problem, ask good questions. Doing so anchors your focus around the important considerations of the problem. With some thinking, testing, and perseverance, good solutions will follow.

## Life goals

Once in a while, write down your life priorities and explain your rationale for those priorities. 

This will help you thoughtfully choose between personal priorities and act as a reference for you to evaluate whether you're staying on track.

Most importantly, writing down your priorities will help you stay committed to them in in moments of doubt knowing that you've thought through your decision thoroughly.

## Writing

Writing is an exercise in critically synthesizing knowledge. I think writing can be broken down into three parts: 1) summarizing, 2) drawing connections to your life and other knowledge, and 3) expressing personal opinions.

I believe in writing about what I read, think about, and work on as a healthy habit thinking exercise. 

## Learn actively

Learning by doing is the best, most direct way to learn. It often takes much more effort than passive learning, which is why it's so effective.

Consistently prioritize active learning in your journey -- through written synthesis, focused drilling, and applying concepts in projects. And devise active learning opportunities out of concepts that you learn passively through through reading and courses

## Problem solving framework

1. Describe: Gather problem details, ask critical questions, and define primary goal
2. Research: Look for previous solution help 
3. Strategize: Plan action steps
    - If your problem is overwhelmingly complex, decompose it
    - Consider also solving a simpler version of the problem first
4. Implement
5. Adjust: Evaluate success, analyze outcomes, determine necessary changes

## Positive psychology

Leverage positive psychology to develop resilience to adversity and superpower personal growth.
