## Who I am

I'm Collin, a data scientist from the Bay Area. I studied statistics at UCLA and am a Metis graduate. 

Right now, I build models to gauge marketing performance at Facebook via [marketing mix modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_mix_modeling). In my spare time, I like to read, learn data science, cook, and play ping pong. 

## Reading

I used to only read non-fiction books, but have come to appreciate fiction. My reasons for reading the two are different.

Fiction: perspective, historical experience, cultural empathy, adventure

Non-fiction: practical/worldly knowledge, self-optimization, domain exposure, reading research, sparking new project ideas

In addition to reading, it is important to actively synthesize what you read through writing and application. 

## Writing

Writing is an exercise in critically synthesizing knowledge. I think writing can be broken down into three parts: 1) summarizing, 2) drawing connections to your life and other knowledge, and 3) expressing personal opinions.

It's important to write about what you read, what you think about, and what you work on. Make this a habit.

## Learning by doing

There are many ways to learn -- you can learn by studying, by teaching, and by doing. Learning by doing is the most challenging, and therefore the most efficient way to learn. 

Always prioritize learning by doing, pick up necessary theory along the way.

## Problem solving 

1. Describe: Gather problem details, ask critical questions, and define primary goal
2. Research: Look for previous solution help 
3. Strategize: Plan action steps
    - If your problem is overwhelmingly complex, decompose it
    - Consider also solving a simpler version of the problem first
4. Implement
5. Adjust: Evaluate success, analyze outcomes, determine necessary changes

## Learning optimism

Pay attention to how you respond to adversity. What do you tell yourself when you make mistakes? 

Challenge negative things that you tell yourself; embrace mistakes; have a growth mindset.
