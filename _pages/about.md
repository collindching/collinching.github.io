## Who I am

I use statistics and programming to help businesses make decisions. I'm equally versed in R and Python, and am handy with Excel. 

I received my bachelors in statistics from UCLA, and consider this website a continuation of my education.

Currently, I'm a contract marketing decision scientist at a FAANG company in the Bay. 

## Motivations for blogging

"Writing is a concentrated form of thinking. I donâ€™t know what I think about certain subjects, even today, until I sit down and try to write about them. Maybe I wanted to find more rigorous ways of thinking." (Don LeLillo)

After stumbling upon the above quote, I knew that I wanted to write more. I started building this blog a day later. 

My plan is to use this website to help me think more deeply about data science, personal philosophy, current events, and, frankly, everything. 

In order of priority, here are my reasons for writing. 

1. Actively process new information 
2. Define personal ideas and opinions 
3. Keep a live record of my knowledge 
4. Practice communication 
5. Have a portfolio
