## Who I am

Hey. I'm Collin and I am a data scientist. In other words, I help businesses make decisions through well-informed statistical analysis. I use R and Python on a daily basis, and am pretty handy with Excel too. 

I received my bachelors in statistics from UCLA in 2018, and don't have immediate plans for furthering my formal education. 

However, I consider this website to be continuation of my learning journey. In my free time, I'll be learning statistics and collecting notes and thoughts here.

Currently, I'm a contract marketing decision scientist at FANG.

Outside of work and study, I like to cook, play table tennis, and catch up with friends.

## Motivations for blogging

"Writing is a concentrated form of thinking. I donâ€™t know what I think about certain subjects, even today, until I sit down and try to write about them. Maybe I wanted to find more rigorous ways of thinking." (Don LeLillo)

After stumbling upon the above quote, I knew that I wanted to write more. I started building this blog a day later. 

My plan is to use this website to help me think more deeply about data science, personal philosophy, current events, and, frankly, everything. 

In order of priority, here are my reasons for writing. 

1. Actively process new information 
2. Define personal ideas and opinions 
3. Keep a live record of my knowledge 
4. Practice communication 
5. Have a portfolio
