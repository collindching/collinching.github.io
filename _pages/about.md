## Who I am

I'm Collin, a data scientist from the Bay Area. I studied statistics at UCLA and am a Metis graduate. 

Right now, I build models to gauge marketing performance at Facebook via [marketing mix modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_mix_modeling). In my spare time, I like to read, learn data science, cook, and play ping pong. 

Below are things that are important to me.

## Reading

I used to only read non-fiction books, because I thought fiction books were impractical. I've lately come to appreciate fiction, for different reasons from why I appreciate non-fiction.

Fiction: perspective, "firsthand" historical exposure, cultural empathy, adventure

Non-fiction: practical knowledge, worldly knowledge, domain exposure, collecting ideas for future projects, sparking new ideas

Importantly, it is important to synthesize the ideas you read through active application. 

## Writing

I'm interested in writing as an exercise for critically synthesizing knowledge. I hope to use it to solidify what I learn and read, to explore interesting hypotheses about the world, and to develop my opinions. Of course, I also want to develop my written and verbal eloquence. 

I see writing as a combination of summarizing, sharing observations, and expressing opinions. I'm mainly interested in writing about books I've read, current events, and technical projects/learnings.

## Problem solving 

I've thought about problem solving 

1. Describe: Understand problem details of your problem -- what is your problem, what is your question, and what is your goal? 
2. Research
3. Strategize: Plan action steps. If your problem is overwhelmingly complex, decompose it. Consider also solving a simpler version of the problem first.
4. Implement
5. Adjust: Analyze outcomes, and assess necessary changes in approach.

## Optimism
