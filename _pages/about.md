## Who I am

I'm Collin, a data scientist from the Bay Area. I studied statistics at UCLA and am a Metis graduate. 

Right now, I build models to gauge marketing performance at Facebook via [marketing mix modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_mix_modeling). In my spare time, I like to read, learn data science, cook, and play ping pong. 

## Reading

I used to only read non-fiction books, but have come to appreciate fiction. My reasons for reading the two are different.

Fiction: perspective, historical experience, cultural empathy, adventure

Non-fiction: practical/worldly knowledge, domain exposure, reading research, sparking new project ideas

In addition to reading, it is important to actively synthesize what you read by writing, applying, and building. 

## Put skin in the game

To stay accountable, put something on the line when you learn, set a goal, or develop a theory. 

Publicly write about what you're working on. Build something that people use. Invest money based on your opinion.  

## Writing

I'm interested in writing as an exercise in critically synthesizing knowledge. I see writing as a combination of three parts: 1) summarizing, 2) sharing observations, and 3) expressing personal opinions.

I plan to write to solidify what I learn and read, to explore hypotheses about how things work, and to develop my opinions on important subjects. 

 I'm want to write about books I read, ideas I'm exploring, and on technical projects and learning. 

## Problem solving 

1. Describe: Gather problem details, ask critical questions, and define primary goal
2. Research: Look for previous solution help 
3. Strategize: Plan action steps
    - If your problem is overwhelmingly complex, decompose it
    - Consider also solving a simpler version of the problem first
4. Implement
5. Adjust: Evaluate success, analyze outcomes, determine necessary changes

## Learning optimism

Pay attention to how you respond to adversity. What do you tell yourself when you make mistakes? 

Challenge negative things that you tell yourself; embrace mistakes; have a growth mindset.
