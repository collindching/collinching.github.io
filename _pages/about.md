## Who I am

I'm Collin, a data scientist from the Bay Area. I studied statistics at UCLA, and moved back to the Bay after graduating in 2018. 

I'm currently a contract decision scientist at Facebook, where I analyze returns on marketing investments through [marketing mix modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_mix_modeling). Before this, I studied data science at Metis.

My key focuses are optimizing my technical skills, writing ability, and investing knowledge. 

## Motivations for blogging

"Writing is a concentrated form of thinking. I don’t know what I think about certain subjects, even today, until I sit down and try to write about them. Maybe I wanted to find more rigorous ways of thinking." (Don LeLillo)

After stumbling upon the above quote, I knew that I wanted to write more. I started building this blog a day later, to . 

My plan is to use writing to organize information, and flesh out my opinions regarding data science, personal growth, investing, and in current events. 

In order of priority, here are my reasons for writing. 

1. Process information actively
2. Clarify personal opinions 
3. Record my knowledge 
4. Practice writing 
5. Have a living portfolio
