# Deep Work Takeaways

These are my takeaways on achieving deeper focus and professional productivity from _Deep Work_, by Cal Newport. I focused on the main lessons that apply most to my life.




## Defining deep work

Deep Work: Professional activities accomplished in a state of intense and undistracted concentration. This work pushes your cognitive abilities to their limit, produces real value, and improves your skill. 

Shallow Work: Noncognitively demanding tasks that are often performed while distracted. These do not create value, and can be easily reproduced.

## Deep work creates winners today's economy

To become a valuable asset in today's economy, you need to be able to do two things really well: 

1. Quickly master hard things
2. Produce work at elite levels of quality and speed

These core abilities depend on your ability to do deep work, as we'll see in the next section. The more you develop your ability to accomplish deep work, the more successful you will be in today's economy.

### You need deep work to master hard things quickly

Skill mastery is achieved through deliberate practice, a well-researched concept that refers to purposeful and systematic training. Deep work is necessary to skill mastery because it is a key component of deliberate practice. 

Deliberate practice breaks down into two parts:

1. Focused practice (deep work) on a specific skill and
2. Constructive feedback to optimize technique

It is thus critical to be able to perform deep work consistently in order to master skills.

### You need deep work to perform at elite levels

Even after our brains switch tasks, some of your attention continues to process on the previous task -- a concept called **attention residue**. The more you context switch, the greater your attention fragments. 

This results in performance reductions that correspond to the severity of attention fragmentation.

Deep work requires the management of distractions, and therefore attention residue. By eliminating attention residue and enabling intense focus, it optimizes productive performance.

## Deep work also leads to greater life satisfaction

In addition to giving you a professional edge, deep work improves your life satisfaction by

- Allowing you to develop a sense of meaning by pursuing activities that matter to you
- Improving your worldview by redirection attention towards positive, valuable, and meaningful stimuli
- Putting us in a state of flow, which has been studied to lead to greater life satisfaction
- Turn the development and appreciation of skill into a meaningful pursuit on its own

## Strategies to cultivate your deep work habit

Your willpower is a limited and variable resource, so it's important to leverage strategies that raise your odds of succeeding when you attempt deep work. I noted only the most useful strategies that I wanted to apply in my own life, skipping over a couple less useful strategies.

### 1. Subscribe to a philosophy of deep work scheduling

### 2. Ritualize your deep work sessions

### 3. Execute like an effective business

### 4. Create work boundaries

## Embrace boredom

Deep work necessitates a long-term commitment to mental training. But efforts to deepen your focus will struggle, unless you wean your mind off of a dependence on distraction. With that in mind, here are some strategies for resisting temptation and maximizing downtime:


1. Schedule breaks: Set aside pre-defined time when you can be distracted, training yourself not to give in to distraction until then. This will rewire your brain to comfortably resist distractions.

2. Meditate productively: Instead of relying the internet while doing mindless tasks like going for a walk, consider pointing your attention at problems that you're working on. This enables you to process your problems from a different mental angle. If you do so, make sure to direct your attention at a specific, concrete problem.

## Limit social media

## Manage shallow work


## TLDR

- Deep work is work done in a period of intense, undistracted concentration
- To excel in today's economy, you must develop your ability to do deep work
- Deep work offers two critical benefits to skilled professionals
    - It enables you to master hard things quickly and produce at elite levels by provisioning periods of long, intense, and uninterrupted focus
