# Deep Work Takeaways

Deep work refers to professional activities accomplished in a state of intense, undistracted focus. This type of work is extremely valuable because it produces real value and improves your skills. 

In _Deep Work_, Cal Newport shares four principles for cultivating a deep work habit. I repurposed his principles such that they apply more directly to my life. Those principles are:

- **Build deep work routines**
- **Reduce context switching**
- **Limit social media usage**
- **Manage shallow work thoughtfully**


## Build deep work routines

Willpower alone isn't enough to become a master of deep work. It is crucial to leverage rituals and strategies that enable you to more successfully accomplish deep work. Here were the strategies I found most helpful. 

### 1. Subscribe to a philosophy of deep work scheduling

To determine when you accomplish your deep work, Cal Newport prescribes four main scheduling philosophies:

- **Monastic:** A hermetic approach to deep work which involves retreating from society for long stretches of time to remain in an extreme state of deep work. Suitable for people who don't have regular obligations. 
- **Bimodal:** Schedule medium-length periods of deep work, punctuated by equal-length periods in which shallow work and other obligations can be taken care of. 
- **Rhythmic:** Schedule a set daily time to work deeply. While the state of focus achieved with rhythmic scheduling isn't as intense as monastic or bimodal scheduling, rhythmic scheduling is the most suitable for people who work in office jobs. This, in addition to journalistic scheduling, is the approach to deep work scheduling that I ascribe to.
- **Journalistic:** Schedule deep work sessions whenever there is available free time. Suitable for people with busy and changing schedules. This requires significant planning to block out deep work periods.  

My approach to deep work scheduling is both rhythmic and journalistic. Before work each day, I schedule a regular deep work session at 7:30am to 9am, which is protected time for me to invest in my own learning and personal projects. When work begins at 9am, I transition to a journalistic approach that allows me schedule my deep work around meetings, communications with colleagues, and anything else that pops up. 

Generally, I make sure to schedule my deep work before my day begins. This helps me eliminate on-the-spot decision-making, and makes it more likely that I will accomplish the deep work session that I committed to earlier in the day.

## Reduce context switching

Both multitasking and context switching impose cognitive load on the brain, leading to significant performacnce repercussions.

Deep work necessitates a long-term commitment to mental training. But efforts to deepen your focus will struggle, unless you wean your mind off of a dependence on distraction. With that in mind, here are some strategies for resisting temptation and maximizing downtime:


1. Schedule breaks: Set aside pre-defined time when you can be distracted, training yourself not to give in to distraction until then. This will rewire your brain to comfortably resist distractions.

## Limit social media

## Handle your shallow work smartly

Shallow work is the opposite of deep work, and refers to menial tasks that are often performed in a distracted state. These do not create meaningful value, and are easily reproduced.

## Motivating deep work

### Deep work creates winners in our knowledge economy 

To become a valuable asset in today's economy, you need to be able to do two things really well: 

1. Quickly master hard things
2. Produce work at elite levels of quality and speed

Both of these core skills are dependent upon your capacity to accomplish deep work.

### Deep work enables you to master hard things quickly

Skill mastery is achieved through deliberate practice, a well-researched concept that refers to purposeful and systematic training. Deep work is necessary to skill mastery because it is a key component of deliberate practice. 

Deliberate practice breaks down into two parts:

1. Focused practice (deep work) on a specific skill and
2. Constructive feedback to optimize technique

It is thus critical to be able to perform deep work consistently in order to master skills.

### Deep work is necessary for elite-level performance

Even after our brains switch tasks, some of your attention continues to process on the previous task -- a concept called **attention residue**. The more you context switch, the greater your attention fragments. 

This results in performance reductions that correspond to the severity of attention fragmentation.

Deep work requires the management of distractions, and therefore attention residue. By eliminating attention residue and enabling intense focus, it optimizes productive performance.

## Deep work leads to greater life satisfaction

In addition to giving you a professional edge, deep work improves your life satisfaction by

- Allowing you to develop a sense of meaning by pursuing activities that matter to you
- Improving your worldview by redirection attention towards positive, valuable, and meaningful stimuli
- Putting us in a state of flow, which has been studied to lead to greater life satisfaction
- Turn the development and appreciation of skill into a meaningful pursuit on its own
