_The book’s first line reads: “History has failed us, but no matter.” Why do you think Min Jin Lee chose to begin the book this way?_

When Min Jin Lee says "History has failed us, but no matter," she comments on how history has failed to illustrate the lives of people who lived through it. 

Some have the privilege of writing and studying history. Sunja, who spent her time and youth cleaning dishes and selling kimchi money to feed her family, did not have the luxury of reading books, or even of becoming literate. 

As a result, meaningful details of historical events often slip through the cracks of our study of the past. And while the more obvious impacts of Japanese colonialism on the Korean people are recorded -- Korean men being forced to work in Japanese sweatshops and armies; Korean women becoming sex slaves for Japanese solders -- many stories from real Koreans haven't been recorded. They just fade away.

Min Jin Lee begins her story with this line because she acknowledges that history has done a disservice to the past. Still, she recounts history as faithfully as she can with _Pachinko_. 

Lee captures not only the tangible effects of Japanese colonialism on Koreans' way of life, but she also explores how the transition to second-class citizen restructures the Korean psyche.

In her book, all the characters deal with complex feelings of shame, guilt, and frustration as they navigate second-class citizenship with limited life options. These complicated feelings, which Min Jin Lee's characters grapple in _Pachinko_, are difficult to capture in a general historical text. Moreover, this book's characters are too poor and too occupied to document their stories.

Each character has different way of handling these complex emotions -- some characters sacrifice personal pride to feed themselves and their family, some excel to prove their intrinsic work, some assimilate so that they can just be, some marry in to achieve a better future. Others reject Japan outright at the cost of their lives. 

In the end, Min Jin Lee refuses to wrap up Korean-Japanese history in a neat package. History fails in general, but Lee offers hope that it doesn't always have to fail.
