## Motivating deep work

### Deep work creates winners in our knowledge economy 

To become a valuable asset in today's economy, you need to be able to do two things really well: 

1. Quickly master hard things
2. Produce work at elite levels of quality and speed

Both of these core skills are dependent upon your capacity to accomplish deep work.

### Deep work enables you to master hard things quickly

Skill mastery is achieved through deliberate practice, a well-researched concept that refers to purposeful and systematic training. Deep work is necessary to skill mastery because it is a key component of deliberate practice. 

Deliberate practice breaks down into two parts:

1. Focused practice (deep work) on a specific skill and
2. Constructive feedback to optimize technique

It is thus critical to be able to perform deep work consistently in order to master skills.

### Deep work is necessary for elite-level performance

Even after our brains switch tasks, some of your attention continues to process on the previous task -- a concept called **attention residue**. The more you context switch, the greater your attention fragments. 

This results in performance reductions that correspond to the severity of attention fragmentation.

Deep work requires the management of distractions, and therefore attention residue. By eliminating attention residue and enabling intense focus, it optimizes productive performance.

## Deep work leads to greater life satisfaction

In addition to giving you a professional edge, deep work improves your life satisfaction by

- Allowing you to develop a sense of meaning by pursuing activities that matter to you
- Improving your worldview by redirection attention towards positive, valuable, and meaningful stimuli
- Putting us in a state of flow, which has been studied to lead to greater life satisfaction
- Turn the development and appreciation of skill into a meaningful pursuit on its own
