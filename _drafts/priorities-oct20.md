# My priorities, as of October 2020

I've been creeping on Blind lately, an app where software engineers and data scientists share their compensation packages from major tech companies. 

For sure, it is fun and inspiring to see what one can make in the course of a tech career. But as I scrolled, I found mysef comparing my salary against those of top earners with similar years of experience. Don't get me wrong: I am well-paid and live happily on my salary, the curse of comparison, inevitably, is stress.

_Am I paid enough? Can I get paid more? My life would be so much better if I had x more dollars. How do I raise my salary to y dollars? What company, which skills, what projects should I focus on to get more money?_ 

Eventually, it occurred to me that I'd left more fundamental questions unanswered: _How important is money to me right now? What do I want out of my next job? What problems am I interested in solving? What do I want from life, in general?_

And then I realized: while compensation is a top priority for people who use Blind, it isn't my top optimization criteria. It has been more important for me to develop my data science skills than to make the highest possible salary, yet I was comparing myself against people who had different priorities.

Which brings me to the point of this post: I believe that it is important to evaluate and record your priorities and your rationales for having them. Doing so forces you to thoughtfully consider what is most important to you, and commit to those decisions. And in times of doubt, these records can be act as a reference and help you stick to your priorities and your plan.

Without further ado, here are my priorities as of October 2020.

## 1. Master data science skills

My number 1 priority is to master technical skills and the business critical thinking necessary to do great data science. 

On the topic of technical skill development, I'm interested not in learning statistical, ML, or programming concepts for their own sake, but for the sake of being able to solve interesting and impactful business problems. Technical topics that I want to focus on are SQL, basic data engineering concepts, ML algorithms, model deployment, and concepts in causal inference. 

On the softer side, I'm interested in honing the critical thinking that is required to define a meaningful business problem, source and determine relevant data, and translate technical findings to actionable and impactful solutions.
 
To note, prioritizing skill mastery is different from prioritizing career advancement; however, I believe that career advancement opportunities will follow as a lagging measure of skill mastery. 

Additionally, these skills will take time to master, which is why this priority optimizes for payouts in the mid-term, rather than the short-term. 

This means that as I pursue skill development, I may miss out on some short-term job opportunities and salary jumps that I would have received due to time that I might have otherwise spent on networking opportunities. I am aware and okay with this tradeoff. 

Lastly, I will be learning by doing whenever possible. This means that I will write about or apply any theory or skills I learn, and try to do both whenever possible. Only with active learning will mastery be achieved.

## 2. Build great learning and working habits

- More related to optimizing my ability to learn
- Study the recurring behaviors that top performers use to achieve their goals
- And actively put into practice what these top performers learn
- Reconsume _Deep Work_
- Decrease reliance on social media.

## 3. Learn how the world operates

This is a more abstract question, but I'm loosely interested in learning and collecting mental models for how the world works. I suppose the main activity that will allow me to keep optimizing this priority is to keep reading on topics that interest me. 

I'm interested in reading economics, psychology, biographical, and historical books and collecting ideas and models of thinking to challenge how I think and inform future side projects and career moves.
