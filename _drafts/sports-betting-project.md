# Combining historical data, analyst odds, and external text data

## Goals

1) Develop a database of NBA team rosters, team stats, player stats, analyst ratings, textual and other external information to analyze NBA betting

2) Test a new source of data to improve the precision of sports bets in NBA basketball

3) Search for patterns between bookies' odds and true outcomes of NBA games

4) Develop profitable model for sports betting in NBA basketball

## Questions

How accurate are bookies' odds w.r.t. predicting NBA games? 

And when are their odds wrong?

How do you evaluate a successful sports betting model?

How are odds determined in sports betting?

What types of bets can you make?

Of those bets, which has the highest highest reward to risk ratio?

## Ideas

Metrics to tune
- Predictive accuracy
- Correlation with bookmaker predictions, via published odds
- Use  modern portfolio theory to design a strategy for bet distribution according to the odds and model predictions, trading off profit expectation and variance optimally
