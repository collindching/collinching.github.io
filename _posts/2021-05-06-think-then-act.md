excerpt: "Taking learning a step further"
---

I have been engrossed with the notion of learning lately. I believe learning opens doors and expands the realm of what's possible. 

Thinking and learning is important. But knowledge is worthless until applied. 

Don't let your learning go to waste - whatever it is you're learning, take that new knowledge and do something with it. Apply it. Build something. 

Why is this important? 
1. Application transforms your theoretical knowledge into practical knowledge - it becomes something that enriches your life in a practical way
2. Action, failure, and iteration are some of the best mechanisms of learning, and help you to take your knowledge even further

My point - have a bias towards action. First, you need to learn. Then - this is critical - do. 

To keep yourself accountable, ask yourself: *What did I do today? How did I apply what I've recently learned?*
