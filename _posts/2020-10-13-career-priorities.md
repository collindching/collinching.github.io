title: "My career priorities (October 2020)"
excerpt: "Why scrolling Blind is dangerous, and why setting personal goals is important"
---

I've been creeping on Blind lately, an app where software engineers and data scientists share their compensation packages from major tech companies. And while it is fun to see what my peers earn, scrolling through posts has also been stressful.

_Am I paid enough? Can I get paid more? How do I raise my salary to y dollars? What company, which skills, what projects should I focus on to get more money?_ 

I spent an entire week thinking only about making more money, until it occurred to me that salary is only one metric, and it may not be the most important one. I am not just a rat in a rat race, and my value as a human being is not how much money I make.  

 _What is important to me? What do I want out of my next job? What problems do I care about and want to solve? What makes me a happy?_

I reflected on the questions above and realized that, while compensation is important, learning and skill development is more important to me. I also realized that I haven't articulated to myself what problems I care about working on.  

This brings me to the point of this post: it's important to evaluate and record your career priorities and reasons for having them. This forces you to thoughtfully reflect on what matters to you. In times of doubt, having this record of your priorities can be helpful reminder to stay your course.

With that in mind, here are my priorities as of October 2020.

## 1. Learn and master data science skills

My top priority is learning and skill mastery, even over nominal career advancement. If I have to choose between a learning opportunity and receiving a salary bump/title bump at the cost of learning, I will gladly choose the path of greater personal and technical growth. With this decision, career advancement opportunities will follow in the long run.  

My number 1 priority is to **learn and master the technical skills and critical thinking** necessary for great data science. 

On technical skill development, I'm interested in learning statistical, ML, or programming concepts as they apply to driving high-impact business decisions or products. I have a lot on my learning wishlist, but topics that I want to tackle with greater depth are SQL, basics of data engineering, modeling techniques and ML algorithms, methods of model deployment, experimentation methods, and causal inference. 

On the softer side, I want to hone the critical thinking necessary to identifying an important business problem, exploring that problem's business/data context rigorously, and building an actionable solution. This is more important than mastering any technical skill.  

As I pursue this goal I will focus on deliberate and direct practice. My primary learning processes will be building, drilling, and writing. I intend to reinforce anything I learn passively (via reading, coursework) through active learning. While this may lead to slower progress and greater effort on my end, I believe this will be most effective for long-term growth.

## 2. Build great learning and working habits

Since learning is crucial for my personal and career development, I believe that optimizing my learning habits will lead to huge and compounding long-term returns. I plan to study the art and science of learning to collate personal strategies lead to a lifetime of more efficient and more effective learning. 

Primarily, I'll be studying recurring behaviors that top performers use to achieve their goals, writing down their principles and habits, and applying and refining a strategy that works best for myself. 

My process for accomplishing this goal will be reading and summarizing books about learning, capturing the key strategies on my personal blog, and then keeping myself accountable to the habits that are most important.

I am very excited about this priority and believe it will improve my life in all aspects -- not just work.

## 3. Learn how the world works

I'd like to learn how the world works and how people operate as individuals and as part of a larger collective. Reading and reflecting on these questions will hopefully help me discover questions that matter to me.

As a more concrete goal, I'd like to accumulate a collection of mental models to help me understand how and why things happen, and tie these back into my life later on. Some of these might be a basis for a future project or career move in data science. But the end state is that this helps me improve my life and someone else's life. 

As a habit, I'll read a diverse range of non-fiction subjects -- economics, psychology, philosophy, history, biographies/memoirs, science -- and amass a centralized collection of written notes. This will be the foundation for connecting ideas between disciplines and developing new mental models.
