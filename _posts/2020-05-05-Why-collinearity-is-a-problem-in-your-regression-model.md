## Unpacking a real example based on a recent marketing project

Scenario walkthrough
- Need to build inferential model
- Signs were not coming out right, and as I added variables they were flipping
- Needed to change the values
- Tested variable of interest 
- Pulled variables out, one at a time, 


Recap 
- Generate a hypothesis for why it's looking different
- Confirm hypothesis by playing with data
- Attempting different solutions 


If you suspect collinearity
- Run a quick correlation table on your input variables
- Look at a scatterplot between the key problem variables
- Test a strategy for
