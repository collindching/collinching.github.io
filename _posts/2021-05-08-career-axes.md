title: "Career growth axes"
excerpt: "The current roadmap for my self-driven career learning"
---

In my continuing career education this year, there are three main axes of growth that I want to pursue: data science, software engineering, and product entrepreneurship. These are my thoughts on what I'd like to learn, and I'd like to revisit this post in December to evaluate my progress. 

### Doing data science

Data science is data-driven decision making that is usually done in a consultative capacity. Data scientists depend on statistics, programming, and intuition to provide business recommendations to companies. 

This is my core technical skillset and primary source of income. I want to continue to invest in my data science skillset because I believe data-driven decision making will grow in importance, commensurate with the world's growth in technology adoption. I also believe that data science work is extremely useful for understanding how to operate a business.

In my current role, the vital areas for my growth as a data scientist are

- project management
- data exploration
  - data validation methodology
  - data visualization workflow
- experiments
  - metric evaluation and design 
  - experiment design 
  - bootstrapping and simulation for experiments
  - learning statistics distributions and hypothesis tests
  - applying Bayesian statistics
- PySpark
- statistical modeling
  - clustering
  - intepretable machine learning
  - regression methods


I believe my main focuses should be the first four bullets. I think this are most critical to my performance in my current work. 

### Software engineering

Software is essentially a service that can be automated, packaged, and sold to customers at scale. This might include data products that improve decision making workflows, or some other tool that makes people's lives easier. 

One day, I would love to learn to build some software that leverages machine learning to help people make decisions at scale. Machine learning is the best way that I can use my current skillset to create an income-generating product.

In general, the skills needed for this type of work include

- software engineering
  - web development
  - backend data engineering
    - data extraction
    - building data pipelines
- data models
  - machine learning
  - building data dashboards
- devops
  - model monitoring
  - model deployment

I would like to prioritize my efforts on software engineering, data engineering, and machine learning pipelines.

### Product

You can't start a company with technical skills alone - building a business involves a deep understanding of product, labor, and consumers. To build a good startup, you need to understand product well. I want to learn how to

- come up with an idea
- understand product-market fit
- learn to tradeoff rigor and execution
- build an excellent product
- acquire customers, attract talent, and create company culture. 

My time will be spent learning about 1) how to craft an idea, 2) how other startup founders build their companies, and 3) learning about execution within a bootstrapped startup.
