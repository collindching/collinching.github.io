title: "Axes of growth in my ongoing career education"
excerpt: "The current roadmap for my self-driven career learning"
---

In my continuing career education this year, there are three main axes of growth that I want to pursue: data science, machine learning, and product/entrepreneurship. These are my thoughts on what I'd like to learn, and I'd like to revisit this post in December to evaluate my progress. 

### Doing data science

Data science is data-driven decision making that is usually done in a consultative capacity. Data scientists depend on statistics, programming, and intuition to provide business recommendations to companies. 

This is my core technical skillset and primary source of income. I want to continue to invest in my data science skillset because I believe data-driven decision making will grow in importance, commensurate with the world's growth in technology adoption. I also believe that data science work is extremely useful for understanding how to operate a business.

In my current role, the vital areas for my growth as a data scientist are

- project management
- data exploration
  - data validation intuition and methodology
  - data visualization workflow
- experiments
  - metric evaluation and design 
  - experiment design 
  - bootstrapping and simulation for experiments
  - learning statistics distributions and hypothesis tests
  - applying Bayesian statistics
- statistical modeling
  - clustering
  - intepretable machine learning
  - regression methods


I believe my main focuses should be the first four bullets. I think this are most critical to my performance in my current work. 

### Building data science products

Data science products are products that can be automated, packaged, and sold to customers. Rather than ad-hoc recommendations, they are services that improve decision-making workflows. Examples include data dashboards and machine learning (and deep learning) products.

Dashboards empower consumers to make smart decisions quickly by giving them visual access to many data points at a glance. The value-add of dashboards is the selection of data points used, and how intuitively they are represented. 

Machine learning products allows us to offer decision-making at scale, in the form automation. Machine learning is the best way I can think of to use my current skillset and turn it into a income-producing product.

In general, the skills needed for this type of work include

- data fundamentals
  - software engineering
  - data extraction
  - building data pipelines
- data models
  - machine learning
  - deep learning
  - building data dashboards
- devops
  - model monitoring
  - model deployment

I would like to prioritize my efforts on software engineering, building data pipelines, and learning machine learning and deep learning.

### Product/entrepreneurship

You can't start a company with technical skills alone - building a business involves a deep understanding of product, labor, and consumers. I believe starting a business is incredibly multidisciplinary, and requires multidisciplinary learning. 

There are so many things I want to learn, but off the top of my head, I'd like to learn how to

- come up with an idea
- understand product-market fit
- learn to tradeoff rigor and execution
- build an excellent product
- acquire customers, attract talent, and create company culture. 

My time will be spent learning about 1) how to craft an idea, 2) how other startup founders build their companies, and 3) learning about execution within a bootstrapped startup.
