title: "Axes of growth in my ongoing career education"
excerpt: "The current roadmap for my self-driven career learning"
---

In my continuing career education this year, there are three main axes of growth that I want to pursue: data science, machine learning, and business and product.

### Doing data science

Data science is data-driven decision making, often done in a consultative capacity. Data scientists depend on statistics, programming, and intuition to provide business recommendations to companies. 

This is my core technical skillset and primary source of income. Data-driven decision making is important, and I believe it will grow in importance as technology grows.

In my current role, the vital areas for my growth as a data scientist are:
- Developing a framework for validating data
- Optimizing my data exploration skillset for both speed and coverage
- Metric design 
- Experiment design strategies
- Leveraging resampling and simulation for experiments
- Learning to structure massive amounts of data via clustering
- Growing my vocabulary of hypothesis tests
- Learning applications of Bayesian statistics

### Building data science products

Data science products are products that can be automated, packaged, and sold to customers. They aren't ad-hoc recommendations, but services that improve the decision-making workflow. 

These include informational dashboards and machine learning products.

Dashboards empowers consumers to make smart decisions quickly by giving them visual access to many data points at a glance. The value-add of dashboards is the selection of data points used, and how intuitively they are represented. 

Machine learning products allows us to offer decision-making at scale, in the form automation. Machine learning is the best way I can think of to use my current skillset and turn it into a income-producing product.

In general, the skillsets needed for this type of work:
- Data extraction
- Building data pipelines
- Machine learning methods
- Building dashboard data visualizations
- Monitoring models
- Model deployment as API

### Business and product

You can't start a company without knowing the fundamentals of building a business and creating an effective product. 

That's why I need to read and learn about how to come up with an idea, understand product-market fit, learn to tradeoff rigor and execution, build an excellent product, acquire customers, attract talent, and create company culture.
